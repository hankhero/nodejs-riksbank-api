# nodejs-riksbank-api
Get data from riksbankens open api

Supports all soap endpoints in a "low level" fashion on `api.getXYZwhateverRBcallsIt`, but also a sample of a more convenient function `getSEKperUSD(fromDate,toDate)`
(since that was what I was interested in).

See `test.js` too for some code samples.
